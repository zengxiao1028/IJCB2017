Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has achieved
unprecedented success in many challenging
domains~\cite{mnih2015human,silver2016mastering}, by combining the power of modeling complex
functions of deep learning and the fairly general-purpose framework of reinforcement learning.
In this project, we will propose a new methods in DRL for the purpose of playing games such as Atari.
The experiments will be conducted on OpenAI Gym~\cite{brockman2016openai} and performance of our method will be compared with
competing state-of-arts such as A3C algorithm.
