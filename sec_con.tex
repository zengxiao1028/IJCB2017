In this paper, we propose a deep learning approach for automatic fingerprint type classification. We design a deep ConvNet based on residual network. To preserve as much fingerprint details as possible, the input image is designed to be  $512\times512$ and we can use two early convolutional layers to reduce the computational cost. The deep ConvNet serves as a feature extractor and on top of that a SVM is trained as the final classifier. Experiment results show that the proposed automatic that does not rely on any hand-crafted features can achieve high accuracy comparable to the state-of-the-art approach even if only label is used. Our proposed can accurately predict the fingerprint class using raw images, avoiding the need of using orientation filed estimation. Future works include using more advanced deep networks and ensemble techniques to fuse multiple classifiers.
