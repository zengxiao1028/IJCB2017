We presented a deep learning approach for automated fingerprint pattern type classification. We designed a deep ConvNet based on residual network. To preserve as much fingerprint details as possible, the input image  is designed to be  $512\times512$ pixels and we used two early convolutional layers to reduce the computational cost.  We did data augmentation to improve data diversity.  The deep ConvNet serves as a feature extractor and a SVM is trained as the final classifier. Experiment results show that our proposed method achieves high accuracy comparable to the state-of-the-art approaches using raw images and without any feature extraction.  We did not report reliability (or uncertainty) associated with accuracy of our method.  We will do that as part of our future work by using different sampling of test and train sets.  We would  like to have tested our method on a larger datasets, but we were limited by the availability of ground-truth pattern class labels.  We are seeking solutions for that.  Also, as part of future work, we like to examine the robustness of our method particularly when dealing with images of poor quality.
Other future works include using more advanced deep networks and ensemble techniques to fuse multiple classifiers.
