In this project, we will use NIST Special Database 4 \cite{nist-db-4} for our experiments. Some samples can be seen in Fig.\ref{fig.fingerprint_classes}.
%
The NIST database of fingerprint images contains 2000 8-bit gray scale fingerprint image pairs, totally 4000 images.
%
Each image is 512-by-512 pixels with 32 rows of white space at the bottom and classified using one of the five following classes: Arch, Left and Right Loops, Tented Arch, Whorl.
%
Each of the five classes has 400 pairs. Each of the fingerprint pairs are two completely different rollings of the same fingerprint.
